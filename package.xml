    <summary>With Xpressbuy ProductVariants retailers can present customers with related products or variants of the current product selected by customer.&#xD;
&#xD;
XpressBuy is a service that allows a retailer to drive in-the-moment purchases of their products. Anywhere a user engages with their brand, shoppers will be able to make purchases without having to go to the retailer&#x2019;s site. XpressBuy works across all platforms (mobile and desktop), social networks (including Facebook and Twitter), within Apps, within e-mails, and in all types of Advertising (native ads, banner, video, etc.). Allowing buying &#x201C;in-the-moment&#x201D; drives higher conversion rates and, thus, higher ROI. Keeping the user &#x201C;in-the-moment&#x201D; while simultaneously lowering barriers to purchase (such as automatically retrieving address information from the user&#x2019;s mobile carrier), drives conversion rates higher by 2X to 6X and drives up average order value by up to 74%.</summary>
